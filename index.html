          <h1>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h1>
          <div id="content">
            <p>
                I've been learning Next.js and TypeScript, and it's been a thrilling
                ride so far. I've built some cool projects, dived deep into advanced
                features, and even started contributing to open-source projects. But
                now, I'm ready to level up and take on a new challenge: becoming a
                full-stack developer.
    
                <h2>Step 1: Deepen My Next.js and TypeScript Knowledge</h2>
                First, I want to solidify my foundation. I've enrolled in some
                advanced courses on Next.js and TypeScript, and I plan to build more
                complex projects. Staying up-to-date with the latest features and best
                practices is also a priority, so regular reading of documentation
                and tech blogs is a must. 
                <h2>Step 2: Begin My Backend Journey</h2>
                Next, I'll start exploring the backend. I've chosen Node.js and Express.js
                as my entry points. The plan is to build simple backend services,
                understanding how to set up servers, handle requests, and manage
                data. I'll begin with RESTful APIs, getting hands-on with creating,
                reading, updating, and deleting operations. 
                <h2>Step 3: Dive into Databases</h2>
                Backend development isn't complete without understanding
                databases. I'll start with relational databases like PostgreSQL,
                learning how to design schemas, write SQL queries, and manage data
                effectively. NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, are on the list too, as
                they offer flexibility for different types of applications. 
 
                <h2>Step 4: Advanced Backend Techniques </h2>
                With a solid foundation in both frontend and backend, I'll dive deeper into backend
                technologies, exploring advanced concepts in Node.js, Express.js,
                and other frameworks like NestJS. This includes learning about
                authentication, authorization, and security best practices to build
                robust and secure applications. 
                <h2>Step 5: Full-Stack Projects</h2>
                It's time to bring it all together. I'll work on full-stack projects,
                building applications from the ground up. This will involve setting
                up the backend, integrating it with the frontend, and ensuring
                everything works seamlessly.
                <h2>Step 6: Cloud and DevOps</h2>
                Understanding cloud services and DevOps practices
                will be crucial for deploying and maintaining applications. I'll get
                hands-on with platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, learning
                about CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and
                orchestration with Kubernetes. 
                <br />
                By the end of these two
                years, I aim to be a well-rounded full-stack developer, confident in
                my ability to tackle both frontend and backend challenges. It's
                going to be a lot of work, but I'm excited about the journey and the
                skills I'll acquire along the way.
